Raison dÃªtre:

People who work on screens a lot often suffer from bad posture. 

For this dev, that mostly means my chin advances forward way far, and puts a ton of strain on my neck and back muscles. 
This leads to a ton of pain which can really ruin my day. 

Using the Eyepop.ai API during their 24hr hackathon on 10-14-23, I created a simple program which uses Eyepop's ability to identify eye coordinates. 

The program starts by asking the user to set a good posture by pulling their chin back towards their neck, then setting a bad posture by pushing their chin forward. 

Then, every 10s it takes an image and compares the eye distance. If the head is advanced 75% or more of the range between the good and bad postures, it plays an audio file notifying the user that their chin is too far forward.
